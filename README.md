# Keep-Note Web App

The Keep-Note Web App is a single-page application developed using Angular that empowers users to efficiently manage and maintain their notes. This project has been developed through several stages, with the current focus being on Stage 8.


### Key Features and Enhancements

1. **Edit and Delete Notes:** Users can now modify and remove existing notes effortlessly. The "Edit Note" functionality allows users to update the content of their notes, providing greater flexibility and control over their information. Additionally, the "Delete Note" feature enables users to easily remove notes they no longer need.

2. **Angular Router Integration:** We've seamlessly integrated the Angular Router into the app. This enables smooth navigation between different views, enhancing the overall user experience. The navigation process has been streamlined, making it intuitive and hassle-free.

3. **Edit Note View:** The "Edit Note" view has been introduced, which lets users edit their notes conveniently. The view fetches the specific note using the provided ID and allows users to make necessary modifications. This feature simplifies the process of updating notes without any complexities.

4. **Deletion Functionality:** Deleting notes has been made straightforward. Each note card features a delete button, which, when clicked, triggers the deletion process. Once a note is deleted, it is promptly removed from the array of notes, ensuring accurate data management.

5. **AppRoutingModule:** To maintain clean and organized routing, we've created a dedicated `AppRoutingModule`. This module defines and manages the routes used within the application. The structure ensures clarity and easy maintenance of the routing configurations.

6. **Defined Routes:** Within the `AppRoutingModule`, we've meticulously defined the routes that facilitate seamless navigation. This includes paths to the "Notes" view, the "Edit Note" view, the "Registration" view, and a wildcard route to handle any unexpected errors.

7. **Dynamic Component Loading:** The NavBarComponent dynamically loads the various components of the application, creating a fluid and dynamic user interface. This ensures a cohesive user experience while navigating through the app.

8. **Programmatic Navigation:** We've introduced the `RouterService`, a custom Angular service, to facilitate programmatic navigation. This service aids users in transitioning between views smoothly and efficiently, enhancing usability.
